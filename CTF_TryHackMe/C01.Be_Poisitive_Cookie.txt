Be POISITIVE

[*] Libra Dnuf Marketplace

    [-] Libra Dnuf is known underground as a marketplace to sell sensitive information and lost secrets. This place has long closed registration but only allows reputable members to exchange items. During a reconnaissance, 0x1115 team caught the exchange of two members codenamed alice and bob.

    [-] After analyzing the packets, 0x1115 was able to decrypt the passwords for alice and bob that matched the usernames. With this loophole, the analysis team continues to detect the Transfer Function between users after passing the authentication portal.

[*] Okay, we will start server and connect. 

[*] Targer: 103.97.125.53:32030

    [-] We can see the login page and we can try bob, alice account. 

    [-] Bob's account: 

        [+] username: bob 
            password: bob

    [-] Alice's account:

        [+] username: alice 
            password: alice

    [-] After log in to this website, we can see something like: Market, Transfer, Logout. 
        Alice's account have Rollback

        [+] Rollback help we can refresh money when we failed in challenge.

    [-] To start, each account will have 1500$. We have to find a way to transfer enough money to buy the flag item.

        [+] Hummmmm, each account will have 1500$. 

        [+] Example: Bob transfer to Alice 1500$, Alice will have 3000$. But Flag item have 3001$. 

[*] Okay, we read the task is "POISITIVE". Can we think about "Poisitive number" ? 

    [-] We will try transfer "negative number". Before transfer we need edit something in sourcecode. 

    [-] <div class="pure-control-group">
			<label>Amount</label>
				<input type="number" name="amount" min="0">
		</div> 

        [+] We change value of "min" = -1501

        [+] Now we will try transfer "-1501$"

        Transferred $-1501 to alice

        [+] okay, Alice have -1$, but we will see again Bob's account. 

            He has 3001$. 

        [+] That's basic math: 1500 - (-1501) = 3001 

    [-] Now Bob's account can buy the flag item

    [!] Flag is: CHH{ThiS_i5_Y0ur_FaKE_fLaG}
